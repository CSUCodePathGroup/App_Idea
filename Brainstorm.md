1. Reminder App
   - **Description**: Prompts the user to enter a task or a chore along with the date and time that they want to be reminded of that chore. Then, when the date and time is satisfied, the app will send a pop up notification or an alarm, in case the user forgot the chore that was entered.

   - **Habit:** The average person will always have some form of task or chore to accomplish in the near future, which means that a user will be using this app depending on how busy they are.
   - **Scope:**  The application can be seen as a simple reminder app at first, then it can possibly evolve, with additional UI changes and some expansions, into an app that can be seen as mandatory and efficient as an ordinary clock alarm that 95% of people use to wake up in the morning for work or class.

   - **Habit:** There are alot of students who do not know what majors they should choose. However, for the individual person, the app is not that addictive since it will accomplish one task. However, the overall use by multiple people will be much higher.
   - **Scope:** The app can be seen as very helpful to college students who have no idea on what major to choose, the student's choosing can be split up into usual college major salaries, interest, and strong subject areas and interest.

3. Calorie tracker

   - **Scope:** The app will be essential to those who are looking to lose weight. The app can be evolved with some modifications. For example, the app can ask for a user's food serving size and it will calculate the number of calories for them.

4. TODO-List

   - **Scope:**  The application can be seen as a simple TODO-List at first, then it can possibly evolve, with additional UI changes and some expansions, into an app that can be seen as mandatory and efficient for people who do not have a good memory or for very busy people who tend forget their task.

5. Purchase Tracker
   - **Description**: Typically, this is a clone or a mock of mobile online banking applications, but a more fancy User Interface.
   - **Category:** Finance/ Lifestyle
   - **Story:** User can enter their account balance on the application, then when that person makes a purchase, the app will subtract that purchase cost from their balance. Also, based on the person's balance, the app will say if a person's account is in the low balance mode. This is just a warning to the user so they can be more mindful of their purchases.
   - **Market:** Any individual can utilize this application.
   - **Habit:** As of now, we can say that the app might not be that addictive since there are mobile banking apps associated with banks, but possibly if the app is given permission to access a user's account, then the app will be much more addictive since it will also have a more addictive UI.
   - **Scope:**  The application can be seen as a simple mobile banking app, but what makes it different is the addictive UI. Most online banking apps do not have an attractive UI, therefore, for now the user will have to manually enter their purchases in, but in the future, the app can possibly access a person's bank account so the deductions and balances can be automatic.
